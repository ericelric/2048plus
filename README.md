# 2048plus Game

## Description

This is a fully functional clone of the classic 2048 game, created as a practice project to improve skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features:

- **CSS Grid**: Used for creating the dynamic game grid layout.
- **CSS Container Queries**: Ensures responsive design for a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
- **Light and Dark Mode**: Implemented using the [Theme Switcher](https://github.com/argyleink/gui-challenges/tree/main/theme-switch) from Argyle Ink's GUI Challenges.
- **Flexible Grid**: Option to change the grid size for an extended version of the game, supporting the 4096 mode.
- **Celebratory Effect**: Added confetti animation using [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) after winning the game.

Feel free to explore and play!
